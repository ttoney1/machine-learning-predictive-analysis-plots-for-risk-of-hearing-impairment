# machine-learning-predictive-analysis-plots-for-risk-of-hearing-loss
Python program to conduct a machine learning technique. Code creates Kaplan Meier plots for multiple cohorts to predict probability of hearing loss beyond a certain time points. Program creates a user-defined function to loop through the same code for multiple cohorts, reducing repetitive code.
